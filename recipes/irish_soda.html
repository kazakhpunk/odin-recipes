        <h4>Descriptio:n</h4>
        <p>Irish soda bread made with buttermilk and basic pantry ingredients. The buttermilk gives this crusty loaf a good flavor. It's the best Irish soda bread around!</p>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>: This classic Irish soda bread starts with all-purpose flour</li>
            <li><strong>Margarine</strong>: Margarine has a higher water content than butter, so the results are often softer. If you want, you can substitute Irish butter</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Four tablespoons of sugar add the perfect amount of sweetness</li>
            <li><strong>Leaveners</strong>: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the Irish soda bread</li>
            <li><strong>Buttermilk</strong>: A cup of buttermilk adds flavor and helps the loaf rise even higher</li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg lends richness and flavor. Plus, it helps bind the dough together</li>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong>: Brush the unbaked loaf with a mixture of buttermilk and butter before you bake it for extra flavor and shine</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>

            <li>Combine the first six ingredients in a bowl. Stir in the buttermilk and egg</li>
