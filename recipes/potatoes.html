        <img src = "../photos/potatoes.jpg"> 
        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>A little something different from traditional mashed potatoes, for the Instant Pot. The leeks add a very mild oniony flavor. Enjoy!</p>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>1 leek, white parts only, quartered lengthwise and finely sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
            <li>water to cover</li>
            <li>1/3 cup milk, warmed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine potatoes, leek, and salt in a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot). Add water to cover, about 2 cups. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow about 10 minutes for pressure to build</li>
            <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 10 minutes. Carefully release remaining pressure using the quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Drain potatoes well and return them to the pot</li>
            <li>Select Saute function. Toss potatoes until dried and starting to sizzle, about 3 minutes. Add butter; stir until melted. Add milk. Mash potatoes with the back of a wooden spoon for a rustic mash, or run them through a ricer for a smoother mash. Taste and adjust the salt</li>
        </ol>
